#Pair programming notes
1. Enable line number and address the code using the line numbers
2. Lift you hands of the controls when your pairting partner goes for the controls (However, I do not fully agree with this but it is somehow true)
3. Suggest something as soon as you see it. Also always listen to your pairing partner when coding and do not dictate.
4. Thinking out loud will help to find a solution for the problem much easier
5. Do not interrupt you partner when they are writing code and let them finish
6. Paying attentioni is very important. DO NOT PLAY WITH YOUR PHONE!!!
7. Praise the good job
8. Not pairing with one person all the time
9. Pairing with new people gives you new perspectives to the problem
