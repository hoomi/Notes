#Postgres notes

* PostgreSQL supports the standard SQL types int, smallint, real, double precision, char(N), varchar(N), date, time, timestamp, and interval, as well as other types of general utility and a rich set of geometric types. PostgreSQL can be customized with an arbitrary number of user-defined data types. Consequently, type names are not syntactical key words, except where required to support special cases in the SQL standard. [More Info](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/datatype.html)
